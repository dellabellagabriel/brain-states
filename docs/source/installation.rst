Installation
============

Follow these instructions to install **My Project**.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before installing, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or later.
- `pip` (Python's package installer).
- A virtual environment (optional, but recommended).

If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website:
`https://www.python.org/downloads/`

Installing via pip
------------------

The easiest way to install **My Project** is through pip. To install it from the Python Package Index (PyPI), simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install myproject

If you're using a virtual environment (recommended), activate the environment first, then run the pip command.

Installing from Source
-----------------------

To install from the source, clone the repository and install the dependencies manually:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myproject.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd myproject

3. Install the required dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the setup script to install the package:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python setup.py install

Note: You can use `--user` if you want to install the package locally for your user:

.. code-block:: bash

   python setup.py install --user

Installing in Development Mode
------------------------------

If you'd like to contribute to the development of **My Project**, you can install it in "development mode" by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e .

This will install the project as an editable package, allowing you to make changes and have them take effect without reinstalling.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- **Missing dependencies**: If you encounter missing dependencies, ensure all requirements are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Permission issues**: If you face permission issues during installation, try adding `sudo` (on Linux/macOS) or run as Administrator (on Windows).
- **Virtual environments**: If you're unsure about using virtual environments, consider checking out `virtualenv` or `conda` to manage dependencies in isolated environments.
